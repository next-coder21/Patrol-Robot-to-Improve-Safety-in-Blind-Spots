# Patrol-Robot-to-Improve-Safety-in-Blind-Spots

Objective
To design an IoT device for patroling and monitoring blind spots along with image processing technology .
Our system sends an message along with GPS location with buzzer sounding in the device.

Working Principle
Firstly, we have to connect the NodeMCU and Raspberry pi in the same wifi network, Now the pi ip will be shown in the device. Connect with the vnc viewer. The raspberry screen will be visible in your system. Run the facial recognition file by pressing f5. When sound is detected the patrol robot will stop its movement and sent the current location coordinates to the blynk iot application. Here we can also control it automatically and manually.
